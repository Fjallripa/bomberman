# Report notes

## Introduction
 State the problem you are trying to solve and give a brief overview of available methods.


## Methods
Describe the reinforcement learning methods and regression models you finally implemented, including all crucial design choices. You may also describe approaches you tried and abandoned later, including the reasons. Include references to relevant literature. Recall that each team should implement at least two different agents.


## Training
Describe your training process, including all tricks employed to speed it up (e.g. self play strategy, design of auxilliary rewards, prioritization of experience replay and so on). 

* Symmetry: order-invariance


## Experiments & Results
Report experimental results (e.g. training progress diagrams, performance comparisons between your agents and the predefined ones), describe interesting observations, and discuss the difficulties you faced and how you overcame them.


## Conclusion
Conclude the findings of your report. In addition, give an outlook on how you would improve your agent if you had more time, and how we can improve the game setup for next year.
